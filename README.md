## Overview
This project contains a series of guides covering various topics, such as:  
- Backing up data with RClone and scheduling automatic backups using cron.  
- Installing and configuring Tailscale on different platforms (including Proxmox).  
- Setting up Nginx Proxy Manager for convenient reverse proxying and SSL handling.  
- Managing Docusaurus-based documentation.

These documents aim to simplify processes for both beginners and more advanced users alike, providing step-by-step instructions and practical advice.

## Project Structure
Below are the main directories and files you might encounter (only high-level references are provided—no extra code is shown unless needed):
- A collection of Markdown documents describing various setup or configuration instructions.  
- A Docusaurus configuration file (e.g., docusaurus.config.js), which controls site settings.  
- Optional scripts or middleware files that may assist with deployments or custom routing.

## Key Guides
Some of the helpful Markdown-based guides in this project include:
- Instructions on installing Tailscale and securely configuring it.  
- A quick-start tutorial for using RClone to back up local files to remote storage.  
- Steps to install and configure Nginx Proxy Manager on your system.  
- Notes on how to maintain good privacy practices while analyzing basic traffic metrics.

## Installation & Local Development
This site is generated using Docusaurus (Node.js-based). To view or edit these guides locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or above) and npm installed.  
2. Clone this repository to your machine.  
3. Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the local development server:  
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   This launches the documentation website locally. You can access it in your browser at localhost:3000 (unless otherwise specified).

## Usage
- Refer to the guides stored as Markdown files for step-by-step instructions on each subject (e.g., RClone backups or Tailscale setup).  
- For production deployment, generate the static files:  
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  Then serve them from any web server you prefer.  
- Always double-check commands against official sources to ensure the syntax or parameters haven’t changed over time.

## Contributing
- Feel free to submit pull requests to enhance or correct any documentation.  
- Always create a new branch for your changes and keep commit messages informative.  
- Open an issue if you find inaccuracies or if you want to propose additional topics.
