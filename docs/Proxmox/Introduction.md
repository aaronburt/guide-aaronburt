Proxmox is a virtualization platform that combines two virtualization technologies: KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for virtual machines and LXC (Linux Containers) for lightweight container-based virtualization. It allows you to manage and run multiple virtual machines or containers on a single physical server. It's open-source and provides a web-based interface for easy management of your virtualized environments. 

If you want a more technical explanation, Proxmox uses a modified Debian Linux distribution, leveraging the Proxmox VE kernel with KVM and LXC integrated to achieve efficient and scalable virtualization.
