title: Guide's Privacy 
---

This guide utilizes Cloudflare Analytics for fundamental tracking of general data points, such as daily visitor counts and bandwidth consumption. This approach ensures a basic understanding of website traffic and performance without delving into more intrusive tracking methods. The intention is to maintain transparency and respect user privacy by avoiding additional forms of tracking beyond what is necessary for basic analytics.

From a technical standpoint, Cloudflare Analytics offers insights into website traffic patterns, visitor demographics, and performance metrics such as page load times. By integrating Cloudflare services, website owners can access these analytics without compromising user privacy or resorting to more invasive tracking methods. This approach aligns with privacy-conscious practices while still providing valuable data for optimizing website performance and user experience.

I do not intend to track users for any purpose other than ensuring the security and optimizing the performance of the website. The primary focus is on maintaining the integrity of the website's infrastructure and protecting it against potential threats, such as malicious attacks or unauthorized access. Additionally, tracking is utilized to monitor the performance of the website, identifying areas for improvement in terms of speed, responsiveness, and overall user experience.
